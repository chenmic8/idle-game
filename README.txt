Description:

Ever wanted to experience being a programmer with the click of a mouse? Well look no further! 
Much like the popular idle game "Cookie Clicker," this game lets you click the keyboard to earn
money (like a real life programmer). Once you earn enough money, hire some code monkeys to do
the dirty work for you. Scale your programming startup company until you're ready to buy another
one!
